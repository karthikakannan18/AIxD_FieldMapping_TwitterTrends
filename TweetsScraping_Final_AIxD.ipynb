      "1336404883499589634 2020-12-08 20:18:48 +0000 <QueerinAI> Panel conclusion: Community contributions and collaborative efforts of the several initiatives are valuable for establishing the policies for computer vision research.\n",
      "1336398576906366976 2020-12-08 19:53:44 +0000 <QueerinAI> Ends with an appeal to community solidarity and having queer scientists push back against these entrenched theories and assumptions.\n",

      "1336373575700209668 2020-12-08 18:14:23 +0000 <QueerinAI> Problem isn't on building consensus for policy need. Challenge is actually implementing and infrastructuring these policies--what does a publishing platform that allows for seamless name changes look like? Right now changes are very labor intensive.\n",
      "1336372644514435072 2020-12-08 18:10:41 +0000 <QueerinAI> Don't let trans-inclusive policies rest on one person--next person may not be as friendly. Give trans people direct control.\n",
      "1336372163012485121 2020-12-08 18:08:46 +0000 <QueerinAI> Ways publishers can improve: 1. create point of contact for trans people to reach out to (@Google @arxiv ) 2. Publishers: don't be \"neutral\" in this: deadnames are like viruses, all people and systems with it need to work to contain and remove it\n",
      "1336371696190644229 2020-12-08 18:06:55 +0000 <QueerinAI> @eLifeSciences on their trans-inclusive name change policy: very easy to implement!\n",

      "1336369052277620736 2020-12-08 17:56:25 +0000 <QueerinAI> You can change your name on every site, but people all access them through @Google--until Google recognizes a change deadnaming keeps happening in search results. No manual way to change name in Google--opaque \"update cycles\" in propagating name changes\n",
      "1336368495945117696 2020-12-08 17:54:12 +0000 <QueerinAI> \"Algorithms seem to be considered to have supremacy over people at @Google\" on how hard it was to get Google Scholar to recognize a name change\n",
      "1336368322997153792 2020-12-08 17:53:31 +0000 <QueerinAI> Q: AI+NLP and trans inclusion--how does NLP interact with name&amp;pronoun changes? A: NLP has been a primary antagonist in changing my name, esp @googlescholar_ . Needs to be a manual override/user input to NLP models!\n",
      "1336367705595625472 2020-12-08 17:51:04 +0000 <QueerinAI> 5. propagate throughout all metadata 6. policy changes must be matched with educating IT/customer service on the back end--educate on gender affirming customer service!\n",
      "1336367351277572099 2020-12-08 17:49:39 +0000 <QueerinAI> Good policy: the root is centering trans people. 1. Don't publish notice of name change. 2. give author full autonomy in correcting name--permission of coauthors not needed! 3. allow name change regardless of legality 4. prioritize most vulnerable trans people\n",
      "1336366170820157440 2020-12-08 17:44:58 +0000 <QueerinAI> We're advocating for what cis men and many cis women already get: the ability to be credited for our work under our name\n",
      "1336365859581829121 2020-12-08 17:43:44 +0000 <QueerinAI> Three harms from not changing deadnames on publications: 1. Can out trans people, especially worrying to those in areas hostile to trans people 2. Deadnaming retraumatizes trans people 3. Retraumatizing&amp;work to fix policy compromises the ability to trans people to work\n",

Creating newer formal structures might be futile but what would help is bringing caste into conversations where it has implicitly been unwelcome in so far. 19/n\n",
      "1470799070641876993 2021-12-14 16:53:19 +0000 <QueerinAI> To create more inclusive spaces, it’s important to survey the caste makeup of any institution, and think about both the oppressed and the oppressor, keeping in mind that it is a graded system in which the oppressed can also act as oppressor for another community. 18/n\n",
      "1470799069110943750 2021-12-14 16:53:18 +0000 <QueerinAI> In some states of India, citizens are being incentivised to install CCTVs to enable surveillance and security. This creates a binary where the upper castes directly have a stake in policing that enables discrimination against lower caste groups. 17/n\n",
      "1470799067626172419 2021-12-14 16:53:18 +0000 <QueerinAI> For instance, The Prevention of Atrocities Act - a law with provisions to protect the oppressed castes, has one of the lowest conviction rates in India whereas the Criminal Tribes Act in the constitution of India labels certain tribal communities (ST) criminal by birth. 16/n\n",
      "1470799066372055041 2021-12-14 16:53:18 +0000 <QueerinAI> Technologies just act as a veneer of neutrality over an already prejudiced system that operates using records that predominantly criminalize oppressed communities - it becomes a way of digitally encoding caste, race and religion in the criminal justice system. 15/n\n",
      "1470799064258076674 2021-12-14 16:53:17 +0000 <QueerinAI> Bringing tech into institutions like the law is always posed as a way to eliminate human bias. However, India inherited the law from a colonial system already built on caste - Indian social rules and Caste alike were codified by the Manusmriti. 14/n  https://t.co/ZLB2TOI0OO\n",
      "1470799062186139649 2021-12-14 16:53:17 +0000 <QueerinAI> When it comes to technologies and law, people tend to draw a parallel between caste and race. While there is an intersection between the two, people must acknowledge that caste is an invisible marker unlike race, and is also very heterogeneous in its divisions. 13/n\n",
      "1470799060999180288 2021-12-14 16:53:16 +0000 <QueerinAI> This discrimination is more prominent in elite institutes like IITs––where Vipin wasn’t allowed to teach a course due to his caste. Even entry to research centers tends to be restricted, since it mostly requires prior association with the predominantly UC populace of such centers\n",
      "1470799059828961280 2021-12-14 16:53:16 +0000 <QueerinAI> The systemic barriers faced by lower caste groups are everyday lived experiences that are walls invisible to the upper castes. There’s a clear caste division in institutions between those who build structures vs those who fit in. 11/n\n",
      "1470799058608345092 2021-12-14 16:53:16 +0000 <QueerinAI> Institutional access via reservation marks those availing it - India has different rank lists in university entrance exams for lower caste categories and spaces in universities are segregated on the basis of rank eg. institutions have vegetarian messes to cater to brahmins. 10/n\n",
      "1470799057417236481 2021-12-14 16:53:16 +0000 <QueerinAI> All these factors play a key role in producing modern forms of social capital, such as the ability to speak English. On the other hand, Dalits and other lower castes must assert their caste status to obtain equal rights to education and work. 9/n\n",
      "1470799056200814595 2021-12-14 16:53:15 +0000 <QueerinAI> The arguments around “merit” are assertions that reservations cause less-deserving lower-caste people to take the spots of more-deserving upper-caste people, disregarding the historical capital held by upper castes - literacy, networks, land-ownership, mobility and education. 8/n\n",
      "1470799055005446146 2021-12-14 16:53:15 +0000 <QueerinAI> In India, reservation acts as affirmative action for marginalized caste groups which includes a horizontal reservation of 15% for SC, 7.5% for ST and 27% for OBC (other backward Castes). The discourse against reservations is centred around the upper caste notion of merit. 7/n\n",
      "1470799053835288577 2021-12-14 16:53:15 +0000 <QueerinAI> Despite these different manifestations, Caste still has a consistent form of violence associated with it which can be seen in human development ratios, active social exclusion, socio-economic status, agency to exercise civic rights or actual physical violence. 6/n\n",
      "1470799052648312833 2021-12-14 16:53:14 +0000 <QueerinAI> As a traditional marker of genealogy associated with labour + purity, caste becomes a permanent marker of jobs one is fit for, access to spaces and ability to form kin relationships. Its modern nature is insidious and occurs differently in urban, semi-urban and rural settings 5/n\n",
      "1470799051469717505 2021-12-14 16:53:14 +0000 <QueerinAI> Lastly, Dalits and Indigenous Tribes (constitutionally recognised as Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST)) belong outside of the Varna system. Within each category in this division, there are various sub-castes. 4/n\n",
      "1470799050098163713 2021-12-14 16:53:14 +0000 <QueerinAI> Caste is a division of labor and laborers - of which the Hindu Varna system provides a four-way categorization - the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. The first three are understood as the upper castes (Savarnas) owing to their ritualistic purity in Hindu texts. 3/n\n",

      "1469112693646716932 2021-12-10 01:12:15 +0000 <QueerinAI> To this end, it is necessary to conduct research on deployability rather than exceeding benchmark results, and devise data-efficient validation methods. (6/n)\n",
      "1469112692325507074 2021-12-10 01:12:15 +0000 <QueerinAI> Many animal-centric AI systems fall prey to portability and abstraction traps, wherein applying an animal welfare protection and monitoring model from one setting to another causes more damage than good. (5/n)\n",
